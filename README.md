This is a handy extension that can be used to make questions for a conceptual youtube video based on the subtitles. It uses generative AI to make questions. Right now I haven't hosted it but you can run locally by following the steps mentioned below.

- To run this first clone the repository.
- Install extension using Load unpacked in your browser, you can google how to install external extensions.
- Then go to root folder and in command line write npm i and then npm run dev
- Next go to backend folder and make a virtual environment in python, its optional but recommended and then install the libraries using pip install -r requirements.txt
- Then run python app.py
Now you can create quiz from any youtube video that contains subtiles. Enjoy!!
